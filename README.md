# Assignment 1
## HTML and CSS Drawing
_This is the first assignment done for my Drawing on the Web course at NYU._  
I wanted to use things that I liked such as:  
* _Cats_
* _The Lion King_

I took the video that is shown in the background and used css to have the lion king gif shadow behind it 
giving it a nice, appealing effect.

The lion king version I used was from the [live action movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King_(2019_film)).
